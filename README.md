# Artificial Intelligence Search Algorithms
### Implemented in Javascript ES6

Artificial intelligence path-finding/search algorithms written in Javascript ES6. 
NonES6 versions are available as a Babel-compiled file: romania-compiled.js 

Algorithms implemented:
  - [Breadth-first search][BFS]
  - [Depth-first search][DFS]
  - [Uniform-cost search][UCS]
  - [A* Search][AStar] (with straight-line distance heuristic)

The search algorithms find paths from a start city to a goal city in a map of Romania taken from [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition)](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/).

Open your browser's Developer Tools to see the algorithms in action in the console.
